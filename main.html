			<p>I'm Josh and this is my webpage. It's a work in progress right now so it's a bit rough around the edges. If you have any suggestions for making it better feel free to contact me at joshmlucas@gmail.com</p>
			<p>This site is a way for me to advertise both my professional accomplishments in the form of my resume, as well as my personal interests and projects.</p>
			<p>I'd like to thank Lukas Rezek of Miratronix Inc. for providing hosting and guidance in creation of this site.</p>
